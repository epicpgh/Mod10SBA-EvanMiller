## Lessons Learned
```plaintext

This project was an enhancement of our exploration of React.  We're building comoponents that will be reusable in future projects, which is really amazing.  There are less punctuation errors overall because so many of the pieces are reusable.  That coupled with gaining more confidence and understanding of the debugging process makes me see a glimmer of hope that I may someday be able to confidently build out these websites with minimal heartache.  It is still overwhelming at times, but as I learn to navigate the equally valuable part of development, which is problem solving and knowing what questions you need to ask, I managed to make an unattractive, but functional project.
